Good job on Interval Heap
	~16% slower than Min Heap, this is to be expected. Much better performance than two linked heaps
	Indexed are much slower, but eh what are you gonna do (lists would be MUCH slower)
- Begin implementation of IHDSMA* (Implicit Hyper-Dimensional Simplified Memory-Bounded A*)


Need:
	Dimensionality
	Distance function
	Heuristic function

	Pack / Unpack to / from tree
